# Create 
Create a repository in GitHub. Open in VS Code. Add .gitignore and requirements.txt. Create a virtual environment and open it. Create folders, data with prepared and raw subfolders, utils folder with subfolder logger.py. Then download the 3 CSV files and put them in the raw folder. 
# Install requirements
Pip install, then also install requirements.txt. 
# Create utils/logger.py
In VS Code, use File / New Folder to create a new folder named utils to hold utility scripts. In this folder, create a file named logger.py. Copy and paste the content from the starter repo.
# Create scripts/data_prep.py
In VS Code, use File / New Folder to create a new folder named scripts to hold scripts. In this folder, create a file named data_prep.py. Copy and paste the content from the starter repo.
I could not find the data_prep.py file at first so I asked ChatGPT to help create a data prep file to do basic data cleaning and then ran that. 
# Git Add
`git add. 
git commit -m "message"
git push'
# Don't forget the .gitignore
Add the requirements for the gitignore file.
